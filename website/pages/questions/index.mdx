# MAT137 Questions & Guides

by **Alfonso Gracia-Saz** & **Beatriz Navarro-Lameda**

## MAT137 (Calculus with Proofs)

MAT137, Calculus with Proofs, is a first-year calculus course at the University of Toronto.
It is meant to be a first course on proofs as well as a first course on calculus. This is not
a usual combination! At many universities, students study calculus without proofs first, and then take an
_Advanced Calculus_ or _Introduction to Analysis_ that focuses on proving the results used in calculus.

MAT137 aims to split the difference. It introduces all the core calculus concepts, and also proves (and has students prove)
many of the results along the way. Though, some results that can be very technical for a first-timer (like the proof
of the intermediate value theorem) are stated without proof.

## What's Included Here?

MAT137 is taught using an [_inverted classroom_](/guide) model. Students watch videos before class and class time
is focused on problem-solving. This page includes problems designed for class time. Each unit has a **Guide** page
with notes and tips for instructors about each exercise. On the **Questions** pages, you can select questions and
download LaTeX/Beamer source code for the questions. Use this source code to compile slides for use in your class.
