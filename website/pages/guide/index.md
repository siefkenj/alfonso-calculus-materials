# Instructor Guide: Inverted Class

This guide is for new MAT137Y instructors who perhaps are teaching an
inverted class for the first time. It is normal to be confused, intimidated,
or even skeptical at first. We hope this guide will provide you with the
necessary tools for you to feel more confident, and will make the picture of
an inverted class much more concrete.

This document is divided into three main sections:
  1. [Inverted Class: General Aspects](./guide/general-aspects). This section focuses on the general aspects of an inverted class. If
you are not familiar with the term inverted class or you are skeptical about the effectiveness of an inverted
class, we strongly encourage you to read this section first. You will find answers to questions like:
      * What is an inverted course?
      * How is an inverted class different from a traditional lecture?
      * What exactly happens in an inverted class?
      * Why do it? Why not lecture?
      * Does it work?
  2. [Inverted Class: MAT137 Implementation](./guide/implementation). The second section focuses on the implementation of an
inverted course model specifically in the context of MAT137. We explain the structure of MAT137Y, what
happens in class, and we offer some advice.
  3. [Commentated Examples of In-class Activities](./guide/commentated-examples). This section, covering more than half of this guide,
contains lots of concrete example of class activities with a commentary providing some background, explain-
ing how to use the sample activities, and what to expect from students.
